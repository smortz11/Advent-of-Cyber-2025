This is the second day of TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber, which is covering phishing, social engineering, how to create fake login pages, as well as using the Social-Engineer Toolkit. We are put in charge of the local red team and will plan and execute a phishing campaign to determine if my cyber security awareness is required. Let's get started!

The room gives us a Python server that we can start that will listen for credentials through a web UI.  We can navigate to the localhost port 8000 to check out the site, where we can then further work with the SET.

Through SET, we select multiple options for this specific engagement. This includes `Social-Engineering Attacks -> Mass Mailer Attack -> E-Mail Attack Single Email Address`. From here, we enter a large amount of information for the specific engagement, such as a send to email, plugging our own server to deliver, etc. After submitting everything, after a few moments, we can see the post to our Python server with credentials.

With guidance from the room, we can then login to a separate user's mailbox using the same admin password. This gives us the final flag we need for the day.
